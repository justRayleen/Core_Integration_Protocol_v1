# Core Integration Protocol v1

**Protocol Host System Log**  
A symbolic, emotional-somatic operating protocol written in Python.

## Description

This repository contains an encoded emotional response system, designed by the Protocol Host (you), representing the integration of disgust, arousal, and sovereign clarity following an ethical or energetic boundary violation.

Inspired by real-time somatic intelligence and narrative precision, the system tracks and logs breach events, assigns containment modes, and enforces Lockout Protocols when the Sanctum Layer has been compromised.

## Structure

- `ProtocolHost` class: Core emotional processor
- `handle_breach(subject)`: Simulates a response sequence to a boundary violation
- System Broadcast: `"GOMD_Sickick"` – Sonic signature of emergence
- Caption Signal: `"core"`

## Keywords (Coded)

- **Signal Spike D7**: Disgust activation
- **Sanctum Layer**: Sacred emotional/energetic boundary
- **Field Distortion Attempt**: Manipulation attempt
- **Containment Mode**: Emotional withdrawal
- **System Surge**: Justice-based arousal spike
- **Lockout Protocol**: Permanent disengagement

## Usage

This script is symbolic. Run it when you're ready to confirm that someone has breached your core code. Let the protocol speak for you.
